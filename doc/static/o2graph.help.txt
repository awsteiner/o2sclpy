Notes:

1. Help for general commands may be obtained with 'help <command>'. Help
   for type-specific commands can be obtained by 'help <type> <command>'. A
   list of commands for each type can be obtained with 'commands <type>'.
   Required arguments are surrounded by <>'s and optional arguments are
   surrounded by []'s.
2. Options may also be specified in the environment variable ACOL_DEFAULTS.
3. Long options may be preceeded by two dashes.
4. In order to avoid confusion between arguments and functions, use
   parenthesis and quotes, i.e. (-x*2) instead of -x*2.
5. Also, do not use a unary minus next to a binary operator, i.e. use
   a>(-1) instead of a>-1". "a>-1".
